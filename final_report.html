<h1 id="Abstract">Abstract</h1>
<p>Our project presents an immersive, real-time scattering atmosphere simulation in the Unity game engine,
leveraging the visual depth and precision of GLSL shaders to create photorealistic atmospheric effects.

The project models procedural planets using Blender, which are subsequently imported into Unity for a
seamless integration with the overall system.

In addition, a comprehensive celestial movement system is implemented through C# scripting, simulating 
authentic planetary motion around the sun and rotation. To complement this, we have also incorporated an 
exploratory spaceship feature, designed to traverse this expansive space, providing the user with the
opportunity to closely explore the crafted planets and their respective atmospheres.

<li><p>Our procedural planet development process was largely inspired by the tutorial
provided by Michele Vidulis, although we decided to omit certain aspects such as the 
atmosphere, clouds, trees, and more complex textures for the sake of simplicity.</p></li>

<li><p>For land creation, we started with a basic sphere and applied a noise algorithm, 
which was then subtracted from the original sphere. This resulted in a varied terrain 
shape on the surface of our planet. The noise function used in this process has multiple parameters,
including resolution, scale, and depth, which can be adjusted to form different types of land surfaces.</p></li>

<li><p>The oceanic part of the planet is a completely separate entity, which we created from a box mesh
and a subdivision surface. This method gives us a better polygon distribution compared to a UV sphere when
we create the ocean material.</p></li>

<li><p>To complete the ocean, we implemented an ocean shader. The ocean and the continents are joined using 
a join geometry operation. We then added a proximity node, using the continents sphere as the target. We stored
the resulting proximity mask in a variable called "ocean depth". This whole process produced a convincing representation
of an ocean on the planet.</p></li>

<ul>
<li>Initially, we faced several challenges in utilizing the Unity engine due to our unfamiliarity with it. 
  However, since then our progress has noticeably improved and we feel more confortable with the engine.</li>
